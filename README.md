# Tech Blog - Homework 14

## Description

This is a full-stack tech blog web application. This is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

Unfortunately, I was not able to successfully deploy on Heroku to meet the assignment deadline as we were still finalizing Project 2 on Sunday, so a YouTube video of its local functionality is included in the walkthrough in lieu of a Heroku link, as all functionality seems to be working.
